## Description
 
This project was one of my earliest data scienct projects. I used R to explore the data and created a logistic classification model to predict the gender of a person fatally shot by police.

## Format

R was used to [code](https://github.com/SDLoyd/LawEnforcement/blob/main/code/FinalProject_LoydSam_Task3.r) the exploration. [R-markdown](https://github.com/SDLoyd/LawEnforcement/blob/main/code/FinalProject_LastDraft.Rmd) was used to create a [pdf](FinalProject_LastDraft.pdf) of the final work.

## Tools
