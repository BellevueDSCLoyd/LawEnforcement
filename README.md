## Description
 
This project was one of my earliest data scienct projects. I used R to explore the data and created a logistic classification model to predict the gender of a person fatally shot by police.

## Data 

[Kaggle Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/brendanhasz/fatal-police-shootings#fatal-police-shootings-data.csv)

[Other Data](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/home)

I have copies the partially wrangled data used (here)[data/] in zip format.

## Format

R was used to [code](code/FinalProject_LoydSam_Task3.r) the exploration. [R-markdown](code/FinalProject_LastDraft.Rmd) was used to create a [pdf](FinalProject_LastDraft.pdf) of the final work.
