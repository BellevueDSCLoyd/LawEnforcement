## Description
 
This project was one of my first. I used R to explore the data and attempted a logistic model on determining gender of a person fatally shot by police.

## Format

R was used to [code](FinalProject_LoydSam_Task3.r) the exploration. [R-markdown](FinalProject_LastDraft.Rmd) was used to create a [pdf](FinalProject_LastDraft.pdf) of the final work.
